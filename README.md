## About the League

The GC DevOps League is a grassroot movement that has spawn off of a collective desire to change our ways of working, both from a software development and IT operations practitioners' perspective.

The league is open to anyone interested in working in the open, sharing their lessons learned and helping each other take over the challenges that we all have to deal with, even though we come from various organisations deemed "different".
 We're much more alike than some might want to let you believe.

## Membership

As it is, we do not have a "Membership" process.
This is an open community where everyone can contribute in their own way.
However, we do have a Code of Conduct and we encourage you to read it carefully because we want this community to be inclusive and diverse.

With regards to the "member" status of the GitHub organisation [(more details below)](#github-organisation-and-repositories), they have been created to maintain the documentation and plan events.
If you are interested in having a more active role, please request to be added to the "members" of the organisation.
If you do not have the time to review documentation, merge pull requests, organize events, it's **absolutely fine** and you can simply star the repos that interest you, create issues, participate to discussions or submit "Pull Requests" to suggest changes.

We do not expect everyone to take time off their regular work schedule to do so.
But we collectively benefit from any contribution made, no matter how small it may seem to you as an individual.

## Communications

The GC DevOps League uses various channels of communications.

* [GitHub](#github-organisation-and-repositories)
* GCMessage
* Slack
* Twitter

### GitHub organisation and Repositories

The GitHub "organisation" is a way for us to aggregate information material and documentation in the open.
Individually, we do not know everything and, even as a group, we can benefit from having our discussions in the open.
Other organisations and teams have already gone through the process of changing their practices to be more inclusive and open.
Anyone is welcome to provide us additional insights as we go through our collective journey.

One thing that we have observed is that a lot of the information, guidance and tools available out there seem to be tailored for businesses.
As employees of the federal government, we have a different set of responsibilities towards the citizens and we will most likely have to tailor this external knowledge to the laws and internal rules that we are bound to.
Our work may also be useful to help better adapt our internal rules to the outcomes expected by our citizens in this time and age: becoming a Digital Government providing services of value to them.

Within this "organisation", we have created repositories that aim to address certain topics.
These repositories will change over time as we better see how our community evolves.
Each repository has an "Issues" section where anyone can start a conversation.
These "Issues" are not necessarily problems, but rather discussions topics.
You are welcome to create or participate in an issue for any topic you would like.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

If you are interested to become a member of the GitHub organisation, which means having additional "write" access rights on the repositories, please note that we require you to use 2FA.

This is in line with the best practices recommended in [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Direction (Appendix B, For Managers)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32588), but also [GitHub itself](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-two-factor-authentication), general online best practices [here](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-2-factor-authentication-and-why-you-should-care-e8af5808d499), [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/things-you-should-know-before-enabling-2-factor-authentication-2fa-6f11e4b5eab1/), [here](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/start-using-two-factor-authentication/) and [here](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb3ypq/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-you-should-use-it).

In fact, we urge you to enable 2FA for any web service you are using.

If you're asking "Why? This adds complexity, ney, PAIN to my workflow... Uh, too much wooooork!", you probably never had to deal with someone stealing your FREE web service account.

Companies offering free web services are happy to provide you with automated ways to secure your account because they don't have thousands of lined up level 1 support staff to **reset your password**.
If you somehow have your account stolen, most of them will not offer any service to get it back to you.
That then means that the perpatrator gains access to your content (whether email, entire coding profile, pictures, etc.) and starts impersonate you.

On our end, what this means is that, since this is a free organisation, we don't see your email address (and don't want to) and we have no way to give you back your account.
Our only recourse is to kick this account out of the members.

There are, of course, challenges introduced with 2FA.
It's an additional step to perform certain tasks, you need to generate keys to use HTTPS URLs with Git instead of your regular password, etc.

Based on our needs as an organisation, the benefits of 2FA outweight the burden of using it.
